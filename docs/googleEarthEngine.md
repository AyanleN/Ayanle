# [Google's Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine)

### Use
- Established in 2010 as a geospatial analysis platform
- run in the cloud (allows analysis of large datasets)
- public datasets promotes open science and reproducibility 
- cloud computing allows planetary scale analysis 
- users can upload their own datasets and write their own scripts to perform analyses
- The development of GEE as a free resource creates equity within science
- brings a high level analysis tool to a wider range of people, which furthers open science and promotes inquiry, discovery, and collaboration

#### [APIs](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorials)
- Javascript
- Python 
- Rest 

### Structure 
- initially featured a data repository from the past 40 years of global remote sensing data 
- now expanded to include vector, climate, demographic, and elevation data 
- These datasets can be layered to perform complex geospatial analyses
- community datasets are open source 

#### [Code Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground)
- Web based IDE for writing scripts 
- complex geospatial work flows made easy
- interactive environment for developing earth engine applications
- raster data type is a matrix of cells in grid format -- digital aerial photographs, scanned maps
