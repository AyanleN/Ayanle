# Logbook


*Day 1 (6/8)*: Met with Dr. Swetnam and discussed project options and overall goals for the summer. Discussed working on the [OpenDendro](https://opendendro.org/) initiative or instead working with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). Talked about how to setup this website using github: cloning Shruti's (a previous KEYS intern) [repository](https://github.com/shrutir11/KEYS) and updating the information to match my own. 

*Day 2 (6/9)*: attempted to clone Shruti's repository through github's importer. However, this got stuck loading for 24+ hours so my progress was kind of at a standstill.

*Day 3 (6/10)*: Cloning through github's importer never successfully loaded. I attempted to download all of Shruti's files to my computer and then add those files to my own repo to make a clone of her repo. However, Dr. Swetnam pointed out that after doing this I was still missing some key files and that the file paths and structure was incorrect.

*Day 4 (6/11)*: Deleted contents of my new repository and this time cloned Shruti's repo through the terminal using git. After some trial and error (I had a very low level of familliarity with git) I got it to work! 

*Day 5 (6/12)*: Now that I had a successfully cloned repository, I worked on editing the mkdocs.yml to get my own website up and running. After setting up the basics and the URL, I added more personal information to further personalize my website. 

*Day 6 (6/13)*: Researched and enrolled in GitHub Education and CodeSpaces (turns out CodeSpaces isn't available as part of the student developer pack). Continued tweaking and cleaning up my GitHub site (read more of the mkdocs documentation to better understand this). Began research into Google Earth Engine and STAC Catalogs to build a foundation for my project this summer. 

*Day 7-8 (6/14-15)*: Gained increased familliarity with Google Earth Engine and accessed Google Earth Engine Developer. Forked Samapriya's awesome gee community datasets on GitHub to begin working with the repo with the intention of sending a pull request at the end of the summer to send it back to the main. 

*Day 9 (6/16)*: Continued to work with Google Earth Engine and began working with Jupyter Notebooks to better understand STAC catalogs. Worked to understand the formatting of the awesome-gee-community datasets by looking at the json files. Continued taking notes on both STAC catalogs and Google Earth Engine (adding these notes to the site tomorrow). 

*Day 10 (6/17)*: Continued to take notes to better understand the awesome-gee-community datasets and STAC catalogs. Began to transfer notes and information over into the github.io site (still need to make further progress with this). Experimented more with Jupyter Notebooks (need to commit more time to better understanding this). Talked to Dr. Swetnam about plans for meeting with Samapriya next week to discuss his vision for the awesome-gee-community datasets. 

*Day 11 (6/20)*: Worked through KEYS assignment on the introduction, background, and purpose of my research. Read additional research papers on both STAC catalogs and Google Earth Engine. Worked to create graphics in MKdocs to represent the structure of the awesome-gee-community datasets.
