# Logbook


*Day 1 (6/8)*: Met with Dr. Swetnam and discussed project options and overall goals for the summer. Discussed working on the [OpenDendro](https://opendendro.org/) initiative or instead working with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). Talked about how to setup this website using github: cloning Shruti's (a previous KEYS intern) [repository](https://github.com/shrutir11/KEYS) and updating the information to match my own. 

*Day 2 (6/9)*: attempted to clone Shruti's repository through github's importer. However, this got stuck loading for 24+ hours so my progress was kind of at a standstill.

*Day 3 (6/10)*: Cloning through github's importer never successfully loaded. I attempted to download all of Shruti's files to my computer and then add those files to my own repo to make a clone of her repo. However, Dr. Swetnam pointed out that after doing this I was still missing some key files and that the file paths and structure was incorrect.

*Day 4 (6/11)*: Deleted contents of my new repository and this time cloned Shruti's repo through the terminal using git. After some trial and error (I had a very low level of familliarity with git) I got it to work! 

*Day 5 (6/12)*: Now that I had a successfully cloned repository, I worked on editing the mkdocs.yml to get my own website up and running. After setting up the basics and the URL, I added more personal information to further personalize my website. 

*Day 6 (6/13)*: Researched and enrolled in GitHub Education and CodeSpaces (turns out CodeSpaces isn't available as part of the student developer pack). Continued tweaking and cleaning up my GitHub site (read more of the mkdocs documentation to better understand this). Began research into Google Earth Engine and STAC Catalogs to build a foundation for my project this summer.
