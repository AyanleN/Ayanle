# Logbook


*Day 1 (6/14)*: Completed the [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) tutorial using [carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Learned how to create/utilize variables, process tabular data files, visualize tabular data files, store values in lists, repeat actions using loops, analyze data from multiple files, and debug programs. 

*Day 2 (6/15)*: Completed the [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) tutorials using [carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Learned how to create a repository in Git, record changes in Git, read tabular data, modify and commit files, utilize the HEAD and CAT commands, and push/pull/clone a remote repository.

*Day 3 (6/16)*: Completed the [Unix](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) tutorial using [carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Learned how to create files and directories, navigate files and directories, construct command pipelines, process files, write loops and shell sripts, and utilize the commands grep and find.

*Day 4 (6/17)*: Read ["The iPlant Collaborative: Cyberinfrastructure for Enabling Data to Discovery for the Life Sciences"](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002342) and ["Ten Simple Rules to Cultivate Transdisciplinary Collaboration in Data Science"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008879). Learned about the origins of [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) and how it was initially used to support life science communities in their search for a proper tool for data management. Understood the importance of following ten simple rules to help with furthering the culture of collaboration.

*Day 5 (6/18)*: Met with Dr.Swetnam and discussed my tasks for the day.Created this website in order to track progress during KEYS and comply with reproducible science. Added hyperlinks to the introduction page and logbook, created each of the pages using GitHub, and added descriptions to the introduction and logbook pages.

*Day 6 (6/21)*: Added descriptions and hyperlinks to the CyVerse, R, and Python pages. Completed my logbook with more detail. Learned how to launch [GitPod](https://linuxtut.com/en/dbb64871480cf1a06acf/) and then opened a Jupyter Notebook using GitPod.
