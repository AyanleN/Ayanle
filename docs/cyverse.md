# CyVerse

#### Introduction

[CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/about) serves as a way for life scientists to share their data with others around the world through a common cyberinfrastructure. It is funded by the National Science Foudation's Directorate for Biological Science and is currently led by the University of Arizona. CyVerse's cyberinfrastructure allows scientists to store their data as well as share it with others through cloud computing for further analysis. Acting as a way to complete complex analyses and share large datasets, CyVerse furthers open science and enables a collaborative workspace.
