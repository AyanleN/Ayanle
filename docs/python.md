# Python

Throughout this internship [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) will be used to create interactive visuals to help showcase and explain any code written throughout the internships. Jupyter Notebooks specifically utilize Python and allow users to share their live code along with other aspects like images, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, and interactive controls. These notebooks can be used to help with machine learning, visualizing/cleaning data, numerical stimulation, and more.
