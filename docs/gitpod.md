[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is a fully working environment that can be launched from GitHub. Setting up local dev environments is often very time consuming, but GitPod can do this within a couple of seconds. GitPod includes all the tools and binaries that are available on Linux. During this internship GitPod will be used to help launch RStudio, Jupyter, Java8, and more applications directly from GitHub.
