## Assignment 1: Introduction to Your Research

### Purpose of the Research 

To create a **"Research Object"** where anyone can reproduce their research using a living workflow that includes cyberinfrastructure (hardware, orchestration software), containers (specific research software libraries, algorithms, and code), and data. 

### Previous Research

n/a -- this is the bleeding edge!

### Describe The Need For The Study

> **Figure credit**: [Peng 2011](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226) described in the journal [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org) how reproducible research can be accomplished.

Doing reproducible research is hard! 

By providing a templated development environment, using GitHub, GitPod, Docker, and common data science programming languages (R, Python, Java, etc), researchers can use CyVerse to work together more seamlessly and interactively, and students can work asynchronously following easy to follow materials. 

### Problem Statement

> How can a researcher or a student get started with these platforms and tools if they've never seen or heard of them them before?
>> Solution: Develop my own personal profile on GitHub, and add these resources as repositories where others can clone my templates and do their own research.
