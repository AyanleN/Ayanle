# Keys Assignments 

## Assignment 1: Introduction to Your Research

### Purpose of the Research 

To create a **"Research Object"** where anyone can reproduce their research using a living workflow that includes cyberinfrastructure (hardware, orchestration software), containers (specific research software libraries, algorithms, and code), and data. 

### Previous Research

n/a -- this is the bleeding edge!

### Describe The Need For The Study

> **Figure credit**: [Peng 2011](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226) described in the journal [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org) how reproducible research can be accomplished.

Doing reproducible research is hard! 

By providing a templated development environment, using GitHub, GitPod, Docker, and common data science programming languages (R, Python, Java, etc), researchers can use CyVerse to work together more seamlessly and interactively, and students can work asynchronously following easy to follow materials. 

### Problem Statement

> How can a researcher or a student get started with these platforms and tools if they've never seen or heard of them them before?
>> Solution: Develop my own personal profile on GitHub, and add these resources as repositories where others can clone my templates and do their own research.

## Assignment 2: Materials and Methods

### Materials
 - Docker: Docker allows it's users to create containers and run an application such as RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks in this environment. This open platform is an easy way to quickly write code and then run it. It allows researchers to run whatever they want in the container without having to download the application itself on the host. Containers can be shared so that everyone can have the same copy of the container. Docker can be used to push researchers' applications into a test environment where they can run automated/manual tests. During this research project it will be used to push containers and open them in DockerHub
 - GitHib Actions: GitHub Actions allows for the automation of tasks within your software development life cycle. Through GitHub actions users can automatically run their software testing scripts. During this intenrship GitHub Actions will be used to push the code from GitHub to DockerHub and open containers such as rstudio-cyverse in Docker. 
- GitPod: GitPod is a fully working environment that can be launched from GitHub. Setting up local dev environments is often very time consuming, but GitPod can do this within a couple of seconds. GitPod includes all the tools and binaries that are available on Linux. During this internship GitPod will be used to help launch RStudio, Jupyter, Java8, and more applications directly from GitHub. 
- Python, R, Java: Will be used in this internship as an application that will be opened using GitPod from a specific repository.
- GitHub: Will be used to store repository and code.
