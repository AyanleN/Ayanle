# Keys Assignments 

## Assignment 1: Internship Description 
This summer I am working in Dr. Tyson L. Swetnam's Lab. He is a Research Assistant Professor of Geoinformatics with a joint appointment in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment. Dr. Swetnam is part of the CyVerse initiative: a National Science Foundation funded cyberinfrastructure that promotes open source data, science, and collaboration in the biosciences. Dr. Swetnam's research is focused on using cyberinfrastructure to support and encourage reproducible research, along with geospatial analysis. The Lab's current projects include [Open Dendro](https://opendendro.org/), an initiative to restructure outdated dendrochronological software written in C, R, and Fortran into Python. Dr. Swetnam is involved in a plethora of other projects, but all of his projects show a commitment to open science through the use of open data and open software to promote reproducible research in information science. The primary project that I will be focused on this summer is the improvement of spatio-temporal asset catalog (STAC) catalogs for use in Google's Earth Engine. Each spatio-temporal asset is a file or dataset that contains information about the Earth captured at a specific time. By streamlining this process and working on making these datasets more accessible it ensures equal access and promotes open science.

#### Project Description
This summer I will be working on improving the STAC catalogs for the awesome-gee-community-datasets. This is a project spearheaded by Dr. Swetnam's former graduate student and colleague, Samapriya Roy. The project is focused on improving datasets for community use with Google's Earth Engine Catalog, a tool for mapping satellite and geospatial data across the Earth's surface to detect changes and trends. The awesome-gee-community-datasets are a set of community gathered and organized geospatial data that is preprocessed to allow for easy use with Google's Earth Engine. This summer I will work on improving the spatial-temporal asset (STAC) catalogs for these datasets to improve ease of use and access. A STAC catalog serves as a standardized way of storing and indexing geospatial data for easy discovery and use. This creates a common language and format that ensures previous code doesn't need to be rewritten, promoting open data, software, and science.

## Assignment 2: Introduction to your Research
#### Purpose: 
The purpose of my research is to standardize and process geospatial data for use with Google’s Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. This improvement and standardization of geospatial data will be conducted using spatio-temporal asset catalogs (STAC), which will help make these complex datasets easier to index and discover in order to perform analyses of Earth’s systems and conditions. 

#### Previous Research: 
Oftentimes raw data is not ready for analysis, and it requires pre-processing. Additionally, this analysis often requires the installation and utilization of many different software packages. This is especially true for large datasets that are being used for planetary analysis on an Earth and solar system scale. However, the use of the spatio-temporal asset catalog (STAC) specification allows for the creation of metadata that allows datasets to be indexable and discoverable. A spatio-temporal asset is a type of Javascript object notation (JSON) file. This is a data interchange format that allows large raw datasets to be text based. The STAC specification designates the need for metadata on the time and location of the data, a thumbnail, links to the raw data, and key words that describe the relationship of the data, pointing to similar spatio-temporal assets. Following this specification furthers cloud based computing and means that these large geospatial datasets don’t need to be downloaded locally for planetary scale analysis. It is for these reasons that previous research has shown that the STAC specification is an important and highly useful method for designating metadata, especially for large planetary scale analysis (Fergason et al,  2018). Additionally, this STAC specification can be used for Google’s Earth Engine (GEE), established in 2010. GEE initially featured a data repository of global satellite data from the past 40 years; however, this has expanded to now include vector, climate, demographic, and elevation data that can be layered to perform complex global geospatial analyses. Users can also upload their own datasets and write scripts to analyze this data. The development of GEE as a free resource has helped to level the playing field and make large-scale geospatial analysis possible for a larger range of scientists, particularly those in developing countries (Kumar and Mutanga, 2018). However, a lot of this data that users are looking to use with GEE is not preproccessed, and STAC catalogs serve as a potential solution to this. My project will allow more equitable acces to a variety of geospatial data, promoting equality and open science. By improving the use of STAC catalogs it ensures that scientists have access to quality analysis tools like GEE and datasets that are easy to navigate.

#### Need For Study: 
This study will further the use of STAC catalogs for geospatial data. Through this standardization, it will make Google’s Earth Engine more accessible to other researchers and data scientists. Pre-processing geospatial data and formatting it using STAC catalogs makes this data easier to index and search, allowing for its discovery. This concept of open data is crucial in regard to the open science movement. The production of open software and data allows key geospatial analysis tools to reach a larger number of researchers and scientists. With the threat of climate change and the necessity for immediate action, it is crucial to understand Earth’s systems and processes. Google’s Earth Engine allows for large-scale geospatial analysis that can help scientists visualize and understand concepts such as forest fire management and sea level change. The improvement of STAC catalogs for Google’s Earth Engine facilitates analysis and discovery that is crucial to understanding how to prevent climate change and preserve the natural environment. 

#### Problem Statement: 
Many current geospatial datasets are difficult to navigate, discover, and analyze. How can the organization of this data be improved to ensure ease of use, appropriate analysis, and equitable access?

## Assignment 3: Materials and Methods 

To best standardize and organize geospatial data for use with Google’s Earth Engine I will use the Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) Specification. The STAC Specification is the leading standard for geospatial data because it allows for the creation of metadata (data that provides information on the datasets) that allows assets to be indexable and discoverable. By following this specification I will create metadata for the awesome-gee-community datasets to improve reproducibility and promote discovery.

Throughout this process I will use free software such as GitHub, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebooks to improve the metadata to align with the STAC Specification: 
- GitHub is a platform for software development that promotes collaboration and is committed to open science 
- VSCode is a code editor that provides syntax and debugging support
- Jupyter Notebooks is a web-based computing platform that allows for the seamless integration of a code editor, terminal, and markdown files for documentation

This software will aid me in completing my project efficiently and effectively. Additionally, their free nature and public access aligns with my project’s mission of furthering open and equitable science. 

The initial organization of the awesome-gee-community datasets on GitHub is represented by this diagram:

Using the aforementioned software, I will use the coding languages of Python, Markdown, and Javascript to create and improve the awesome-gee-community datasets’ metadata to align with the STAC Specification, allowing its use with Google’s Earth Engine.
